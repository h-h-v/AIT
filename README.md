## Overview

AIT is a hands-on learning platform focused on implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models within IT infrastructure management. Using real-world vendor documentation from industry leaders like Dell, IBM, Cisco, Juniper, Fortinet, and EUC solutions, AIT empowers associates to build intelligent knowledge systems that assist with troubleshooting, configuration, and optimization tasks.

This project guides users through document ingestion, indexing, and querying processes, helping them master the RAG workflow and create AI-driven tools to improve IT operations.
